# ‚úàÔ∏è Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in Aerospace Engineering

## üí° Introduction to PINNs

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate data-driven deep learning with explicit physical laws. They embed partial differential equations (PDEs) directly into the neural network's learning objective, providing a novel class of "mesh-free" numerical solvers for complex scientific and engineering problems. This approach enables the network to learn solutions that inherently satisfy governing physical principles.
